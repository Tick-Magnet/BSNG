A Disjoint-Set Data Structure based Parallel Sow & Grow (& DBSCAN) clustering implementation using OpenMP

How to run the tool:
1. Compile the source files using the following command

	make

2. Run using following command 

	./bsng -i filename -b -m minpts -e epsilon -o output -t threads

	Example:

	./bsng -i clus50k.bin -b -m 5 -e 25 -t 8 -o test

	run the following to get detail description on the program arguments

	./bsng ?

3. Input file format:
	
	binary file:
	number of points, N and number of dimensions, D (each 4 bytes) followed by the points coordinates (N x D floating point numbers).

	
	text file: <?> Not Working
	each line is a point (no need to mention the number of points or the number of dimensions).

4. Visualization: 
	
	After running the system an output file named graph.csv will be generated. Take this file, place it in the utilities folder, and run ClusterVisualizer.py with the graph file as an argument.
	This will require the Seaborn package and Python to be installed on your system.
	
	Example:
	python3 ClusterVisualizer.py -i graph.csv
