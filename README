A Focused Clustering implementation of the density-based Sow & Grow clustering algorithm using OpenMP

How to run the system:
1. Compile the source files using the following command

	make

2. Run using following command 

	./bsng -i filename -b -m minpts -e epsilon -s seeds -t threads -o output 

	Example:

	./bsng -i clus50k.bin -b -m 5 -e 25 -s 5000-t 8 -o test

	run the following to get detail description on the program arguments

	./bsng ?

3. Input file format:
	
	binary file:
	number of points, N and number of dimensions, D (each 4 bytes) followed by the points coordinates (N x D floating point numbers).

	
	csv file: each row is a point, each coloumn is a dimension

4. Visualization: 
	
	After running the system an output file named visData.csv will be generated in the utilities folder. 
	Use the -j flag to run ClusterVisualizer.py with the visData.csv file as an argument.
	This will require the Seaborn package and Python to be installed on your system.
	
	Example:
	python3 ClusterVisualizer.py -i visData.csv
